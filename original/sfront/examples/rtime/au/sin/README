Sin is a MusicDevice AudioUnit. Sin is a simple sine-wave virtual instrument.

sin.saol is described in Part V/4 of the MP4SA book shipped with 
this distribution.

The make commands for this example are:

 "make":  Creates a AU component from your SAOL file in this directory
 "make install": Installs your plug-in and launches an AU host for testing
 "make clean": Removes all files created by "make" from this directory
 "make remove": Un-installs your plugin, and does a "make clean"

The first section of the Makefile documents variables that control
how the Makefile builds the example.
