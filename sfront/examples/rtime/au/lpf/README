LPF, a low-pass filter with resonance, is an Effect AudioUnit with a
custom UI view.  The signal processing code is written in SAOL.  The
view code, contained in the CocoaFilterView subdirectory, is written
in Objective-C.  The view code is a modified version of the view for
the FilterDemo sample AU that ships with the Apple SDK.  The signal
processing code was written in SAOL, to match the behavior of the
original Apple C++ code.

lpf.saol is described in Part V/4 of the MP4SA book shipped with this 
distribution.

The make commands for this example are:

 "make":  Creates a AU component from your SAOL file in this directory
 "make install": Installs your plug-in and launches an AU host for testing
 "make clean": Removes all files created by "make" from this directory
 "make remove": Un-installs your plugin, and does a "make clean"

Note that the Makefile in this directory calls CocoaFilterView/Makefile 
to build the Cocoa view bundle.  However, all make variables are set in 
the Makefile in this directory, and are passed to CocoaFilterView/Makefile.  
Thus, you (hopefully) should not have to edit CocoaFilterView/Makefile.
